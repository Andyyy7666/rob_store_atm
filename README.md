## Description:
Simply walk up to an atm and hit it with a crowbar, blow it up, or you can use any other weapon to cause damage. Once the atm is damaged, it will start shooting out money and if you're nearby then you'll receive money.

## Disclaimer:
I've included config to work with [ND Framework](https://github.com/ND-Framework), the ESX Framework, QB Framework. Or you could write some code and add anything you want.
